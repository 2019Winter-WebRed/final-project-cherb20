        <h4>Early Life</h4>
        
        <!-- This adds a paragraph to the webpage -->
        <p>Inayat Khan, the oldest of four children, was born on 1 January 1914 in Moscow. Her siblings were Vilayat, Hidayat, and Khair-un-Nisa. She was raised in Britain and France and a descendant of Indian royalty.  In 1914, shortly before the outbreak of the First World War, the family left Russia. They moved to London and lived in Bloomsbury. She attended nursery at Notting Hill. Later in 1920 they moved to France, settling in Suresnes. The death of her father led Inayat Khan to take on the responsibility for her grieving mother and younger siblings. She studied child psychology at the Sorbonne and music at the Paris Conservatory. She began a career writing poetry and children's stories, and became a contributor to children's magazines and French radio. Then, after the outbreak of World War II, after France was overrun by German troops, the family fled back to England.</p>

        <p>In November of 1940, she joined the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) and, as an Aircraftwoman 2nd Class, was sent to be trained as a wireless operator. In 1942 she was recruited by the elite Special Operations Executive (SOE) to work in Paris as a radio operator. Records have shown that she was the first female wireless operator sent to Nazi-occupied France during World War II. After avoiding being captured by the Nazis for three months, she was imprisoned. The Nazis tortured her. She was eventually shot by the German Gestapo at Dachau concentration camp in 1944. As the German firing squad raised their weapons she spoke her final word: "Liberte". The word <b>Liberte</b> stands for Freedom in French.</p>
